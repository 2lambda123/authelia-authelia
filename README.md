**Authelia** is an open-source authentication and authorization server
providing 2-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your
applications.
It acts as a companion of reverse proxies by handling authentication and
authorization requests.

**Authelia** can be installed as a standalone service using Docker or NPM
but can also be deployed easily on Kubernetes. On the latest, one can
leverage ingress configuration to set up authentication and authorizations
for specific services in only few seconds.
