 ## Prerequisites
 
+The most important prerequisite that users understand that there is no single way to deploy software similar to
+Authelia. We provide as much information as possible for users to configure the critical parts usually in the most
+common scenarios however those using more advanced architectures are likely going to have to adapt. We can generally
+help with answering less specific questions about this and it may be possible if provided adequate information more
+specific questions may be answered.

+## Assumptions and Adaptation
+
+This guide makes a few assumptions. These assumptions may require adaptation in more advanced and complex scenarios. We
+can not reasonably have examples for every advanced configuration option that exists. The
+following are the assumptions we make:
+
+* Deployment Scenario:
+  * Single Host
+  * Authelia is deployed as a Container with the container name `authelia` on port `9091`
+  * Proxy is deployed as a Container on a network shared with Authelia
+* The above assumption means that AUthelia should be accesible to the proxy on `http://authelia:9091` and as such:
+  * You will have to adapt all instances of the above URL to be `https://` if Authelia configuration has a TLS key and
+    certificate defined
+  * You will have to adapt all instances of `authelia` in the URL if:
+    * you're using a different container name
+    * you deployed the proxy to a different location
+  * You will have to adapt all instances of `9091` in the URL if:
+    * you have adjusted the default port in the configuration
+  * You will have to adapt the entire URL if:
+    * Authelia is on a different host to the proxy
+* All services are part of the `example.com` domain:
+  * This domain and the subdomains will have to be adapted in all examples to match your specific domains unless you're
+    just testing or you want ot use that specific domain
+
