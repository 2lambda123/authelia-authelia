## What is Authelia?

Authelia is a project with several open source developers who contribute to the project in their free time. We are not
a company or another type of incorporated entity, and do not have any monetization model. Individuals and Organizations
are free to contribute [financially](../contributing/prologue/financial.md) or with their time to the
[documentation](../contributing/prologue/documentation-contributions.md) or
[code base](../contributing/development/introduction.md).

## Affiliation

Authelia maintains zero affiliations with third parties which have influence over the project. At the time of this
writing we would very likely cut ties with any third party which made their affiliation conditional on them having an
influence over our direction.

Any such influence in the future will be [disclosed](../contributing/prologue/financial.md#influence) as will any
affiliations via [sponsorship](../contributing/prologue/financial.md#sponsorship).

### Bus Factor

The Authelia team has a bus factor of 3. Meaning that the project would stall if 3 team members were suddenly hit by a
bus.
