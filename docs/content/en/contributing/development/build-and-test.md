__Authelia__ is built a [React] frontend user portal bundled in a [Go] application which acts as a basic webserver for
the [React] assets and a dedicated API.

The GitHub repository comes with a CLI dedicated to developers called
[authelia-scripts](reference-authelia-scripts.md) which can be setup by looking at
[Reference: authelia-scripts](reference-authelia-scripts.md).

In order to build and contribute to __Authelia__, you need to make sure that you have looked at the
[Environment](environment.md) guide to configure your development environment.

## Get started

In order to ease development, __Authelia__ uses the concept of [suites] to run Authelia from source code so that your
patches are included. This is a kind of virtual environment running __Authelia__ in a complete ecosystem
(LDAP, Redis, SQL server). Note that __Authelia__ is hot-reloaded in the environment so that your patches are instantly
included.

The next command starts the suite called *Standalone*:

```bash
authelia-scripts suites setup Standalone
```

Most of the suites are using docker-compose to bootstrap the environment. Therefore, you can check the logs of all
application by running the following command on the component you want to monitor.

```bash
docker logs authelia_authelia-backend_1 -f
```

Then, edit the code and observe how __Authelia__ is automatically reloaded.

### Unit tests

To run the unit tests, run:

```bash
authelia-scripts unittest
```

### Integration tests

Integration tests are located under the `internal/suites` directory and are based on Selenium. A suite is a combination
of environment and tests. Executing a suite therefore means starting the environment, running the tests and tearing down
the environment. Each step can be run independently:

```bash
# List the available suites
$ authelia-scripts suites list
Standalone
DuoPush
LDAP
Traefik

# Start the environment of Standalone suite.
$ authelia-scripts suites setup Standalone

# Run the tests related to the currently running suite.
$ authelia-scripts suites test

# Tear down the environment
$ authelia-scripts suites teardown Standalone
```

In order to test all suites (approx 30 minutes), you need to make sure there is no currently running sui te and then you
should run:

```bash
authelia-scripts suites test
```

Also, you don't need to start the suite before testing it. Given you're not running any suite, just use the following
command to test the *Standalone* suite.

```bash
authelia-scripts suites test Standalone
```

The suite will be spawned, tests will be run and then the suite will be torn down automatically.

## Manually Building

### Binary

If you want to manually build the binary from source you will require the open source software described in the
[Development Environment](./environment.md#setup) documentation. Then you can follow the below steps on Linux (you may
have to adapt them on other systems).

#### Basic Steps

Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/authelia/authelia.git
```

Download the Dependencies:

```bash
cd authelia && go mod download
cd web && pnpm install
cd ..
```

Build the Web Frontend:

```bash
cd web && pnpm build
cd ..
```

Build the Binary (with debug symbols):

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 CGO_CPPFLAGS="-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-strong" CGO_LDFLAGS="-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now" \
go build -ldflags "-linkmode=external" -trimpath -buildmode=pie -o authelia ./cmd/authelia
```

Build the Binary (without debug symbols):

```bash
CGO_ENABLED=1 CGO_CPPFLAGS="-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-strong" CGO_LDFLAGS="-Wl,-z,relro,-z,now" \
go build -ldflags "-linkmode=external -s -w" -trimpath -buildmode=pie -o authelia ./cmd/authelia
```

#### Reproducible Builds

*__Important Note:__ At the time of this writing an unknown variance exists between our build system and the builds
produced via these instructions. We are investigating the cause and are intending to release proper instructions once
the underlying cause is identified.*

*__Please Note:__ The reproducibility instructions only apply for v4.38.0 or above.
Users interested in reproducibility of previous versions will have to carefully modify the linker flags to match the
values outputted from the `authelia build-info` command. In particular the Build Date was set as the actual time
previously rather than the commit time. In addition to this the ability to print the commands did not exist until just
before this tag. If you have trouble reproducing a build please let us know so we can figure it out, assist you, and
document it.*

Authelia intends to allow production of reproducible builds that were built using our pipeline. The only variables
injected into a build are from commit information other than the exceptions listed in this section. This means that we
can provide the exact build commands for any given build with very limited input from users. The elements injected into
the binary as part of the build process (using linker flags) are:

- Commit SHA1
- Commit Date (using the RFC3339 layout strictly using the UTC timezone)
- Latest Tag
- Tag State (i.e. if the HEAD commit has the latest tag)
- Working Tree State (dirty, clean, etc)
- Branch Name
- Build Number

The exceptions of this list which cannot be obtained from commit information (but can be supplied by an environment
variable or CLI argument):

- Build Number

##### Instructions

*__Important Note:__ If you wish to use [gox](https://gitihub.com/authelia/gox) to build Authelia please run the
`go run ./cmd/authelia-scripts build --print --buildkite --build-number 100` command instead of the above command (i.e.
adding the `--buildkite` flag).*

To perform a reproducible build users should follow these steps:

1. Run the `authelia build-info` command which contains useful information for reproducing the build including:
   1. The `Build Number` field.
   2. The `Build Go Version` field.
2. Install all of the required dependencies. It's recommended if you're looking for a reproducible build that you use
   the same Go version from step 1.
3. Run the following command from the root of the repository to output the build commands (where 100 is the number from
   step 1):

```bash
go run ./cmd/authelia-scripts build --print --build-number 100
```

The output of the above command may be ran to perform all of the build steps manually.
