## Before You Begin

This section contains important elements that you should carefully consider before configuration of an OpenID Connect
1.0 Registered Client.

### Common Notes

1. The [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) `client_id` parameter:
    1. This *__must__* be a unique value for every client.
    2. The value used in this guide is merely for readability and demonstration purposes and you *__should not__* use
       this value in production and should instead utilize the [How do I generate a client identifier or client secret?]({{ $faq }}#how-do-i-generate-a-client-identifier-or-client-secret)
       FAQ. We recommend 64 random characters but you can use any arbitrary value that meets the other criteria.
    3. This *__must__* only contain [RFC3986 Unreserved Characters](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.3).
    4. This *__must__* be no more than 100 characters in length.
2. The [OpenID Connect 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) `client_secret` parameter:
    1. The value used in this guide is merely for demonstration purposes and you *__should absolutely not__* use this
       value in production and should instead utilize the
       [How do I generate a client identifier or client secret?]({{ $faq }}#how-do-i-generate-a-client-identifier-or-client-secret) FAQ.
    2. This string may be stored as plaintext in the Authelia configuration but this behaviour is deprecated and is not
       guaranteed to be supported in the future. See the [Plaintext]({{ $faq }}#plaintext) guide for more
       information.
    3. When the secret is stored in hashed form in the Authelia configuration (*__heavily recommended__*), the cost of
       hashing can, if too great, cause timeouts for clients. See the
       [Tuning the work factors]({{ $faq }}#tuning-work-factors) guide for more information.
3. The configuration example for Authelia:
    1. Only contains an example configuration for the client registration and you *__MUST__* also configure the required
       elements from the [OpenID Connect 1.0 Provider Configuration]({{ printf "%s/provider.md" $config }}) guide.
    2. Only contains a small portion of all of the available options for a registered client and users may wish to
       configure portions that are not part of this guide or configure them differently, as such it's important to
       both familiarize yourself with the other options available and the effect of each of the options configured in
       this section by looking at the [OpenID Connect 1.0 Clients Configuration]({{ printf "%s/clients.md" $config }})
       guide.
